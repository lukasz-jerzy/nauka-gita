            Welcome to your life<br /> There's no turning back<br /> Even while we sleep<br /> We will find you<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse-2">
            Acting on your best behaviour<br /> Turn your back on Mother Nature<br /> Everybody wants to rule the world<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse-3">

            I can't stand this indecision<br /> Married with a lack of vision<br /> Everybody wants to rule the world<br /> Say that you'll never never never never need it<br /> One headline why believe it?<br /> Everybody wants to rule the world<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse-8">
            All for freedom and for pleasure<br /> Nothing ever lasts forever<br /> Everybody wants to rule the world<br />
